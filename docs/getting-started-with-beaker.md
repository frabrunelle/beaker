title: Getting Started with Beaker
---

Welcome! Beaker is a peer-to-peer browser for Web hackers. It includes a bunch of tools:

* [Instant website creation](beginner/creating-new-hyperdrives.md)
* [A builtin editor](beginner/using-the-editor.md)
* [A terminal environment](advanced/webterm.md)
* [Peer-to-peer Web APIs](/#apis)
* and more.

In this guide, we're going to familiarize you with Beaker's ideas and tools, but if you want to jump straight into the action, start here:

## What is this peer-to-peer thing?

Beaker uses a peer-to-peer protocol called Hyperdrive. "Hyperdrives" are like websites. They store webpages, pictures, media, user data, and so on. Hyperdrives power a lot of Beaker's best features.

:::note
**"Hyperdrives" are folders you host from your computer.** They contain web pages which you can browse and edit. You can create and share hyperdrives using Beaker. [Learn more](beginner/creating-new-hyperdrives.md).
:::

Peer-to-peer means that you host data directly from your device.

One fun attribute of peer-to-peer is "co-hosting." This is where you help keep a hyperdrive online by storing the data and contributing bandwidth to other users. It happens temporarily when you visit a hyperdrive, but you can turn it on permanently for sites you like.

:::note
**You can "host" other people's hyperdrives** to help keep them online and contribute bandwidth. [Learn more](beginner/hosting-hyperdrives.md).

## What should I learn next?

A lot of Beaker's experience is the social network of personal websites. If I were you, I'd see [how to join the social network](joining-the-social-network.md).

If you want to start hacking on some websites, read up on [creating new hyperdrives](beginner/creating-new-hyperdrives.md) and [using the editor](beginner/using-the-editor.md). If you love the idea of remixing other people's work, you should [learn about forking hyperdrives](advanced/forking-hyperdrives.md). If you're a fan of command lines, [check out Beaker's Webterm](advanced/webterm.md).

The [Beaker Developer Portal](https://beaker.dev/) has a directory of useful resources for getting into code:

* [Templates](https://beaker.dev/docs/templates/). Pre-made hyperdrives you can copy.
* [Tutorials](https://beaker.dev/docs/tutorials/). More developer-focused guides to teach you about building on Beaker.

You can also [find Beaker's new Web APIs here](/#apis).
